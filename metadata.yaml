description: Dark Kensington had been dead for twenty-five years. It was a fact; everyone
  knew it. Then suddenly he reappeared, youthful, brilliant, ready to take over the
  Phoenix, the rebel group that worked to overthrow the tyranny that gripped the settlers
  on Mars. The Phoenix had been destroyed not once, not twice, but three times! But
  this time the resurrected Dark had new plans, plans which involved dangerous experiments
  in mutation and psionics. And now the rebels realized they were in double jeopardy.
  Not only from the government's desperate hatred of their movement, but also from
  the growing possibility that the new breed of mutated monsters would get out of
  hand and bring terrors never before known to man.
